Getting Started
===============

In order to set up and start using Zambeze, you will need the following dependencies:
 * A running rabbitmq server, see `rabbitmq documentation <https://www.rabbitmq.com/documentation.html>`_.
 * Python >= 3.7. We suggest using `Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com>`_.
 * (Optional) ImageMagick to try a first mock example use-case. It is available `here <https://imagemagick.org/>`_.
