Formatting
==========

Python source code is formatted using 
`Black <https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable>`_. A GitHub action has been
enabled that will automatically check if your code is in compliance with Black.
An action is also enabled so that you can format the code automatically by 
commenting in an open pr with the text:

  @par-hermes format
